/*
 * Modifications Made to Exceed Requirements:
 * 1. Added activity counts for Breathing, Reflection, and Listing Activities to keep track of how many times each activity has been performed.
 * 2. Ensured no duplicate prompts/questions are selected until all have been used in a session by randomly selecting a prompt from a predefined list for each activity.
 * These enhancements contribute to a more engaging and structured experience for the user.
